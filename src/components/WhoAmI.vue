    <h1 id="title">Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is <u>Marcos Campos</u> and I have bachelor's degree in Computer Science in the <a href="https://www.ifb.edu.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Institute of Bras√≠lia (IFB)</a>. I got addicted to programming when i was 17 years old since then I had been doing a lot of personal projects just for fun! I got a little bit of experience through academic course, programming competitions, and also with freelancers jobs. Some of the knowledge came from internships did when i was in college. I guess my curiosity is something that guides me through the tecnology field, I had to solve as many as problems i can, even those that didnt have an answer (in polynomial time hehe).</p>
